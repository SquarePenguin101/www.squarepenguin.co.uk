## Getting Help for get_iplayer

get_iplayer itself can provide brief usage examples and descriptions of available options.  Because there are quite a few options, help listings are available at three levels of detail:

	get_iplayer --help
	get_iplayer --basic-help
	get_iplayer --long-help

Web PVR Manager users should click the **Help** button at the top right of the page.

Unix/OS X users who installed a packaged version of get_iplayer may have access to a manual page:

	man get_iplayer

Windows users can go to `All Programs -> get_iplayer -> Help -> get_iplayer Examples` (`All Apps -> get_iplayer -> Help -> get_iplayer Examples` in Windows 10).  If you are using the Windows 8 Start screen you will need to show "All Apps" to see the `get_iplayer Examples` tile.  The Windows shortcut will take you to [Usage and Examples](/wiki/documentation).

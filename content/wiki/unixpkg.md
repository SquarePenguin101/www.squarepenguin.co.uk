## Unix Package Installation

get_iplayer has been packaged for several distros (list below). **These packages are NOT part of get_iplayer itself and are not supported by the get_iplayer maintainer.** If you have any problems installing a packaged version of get_iplayer, or you are left with an incomplete or broken installation, contact the packager via whatever channel is appropriate for your distro.

The packages are maintained by volunteers and may not be updated for a short time after a new release of get_iplayer, thus the version of get_iplayer packaged for your system may be obsolete. You can find the version number of the latest get_iplayer release [here](https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/releases). If the version packaged for your system is older than the latest release, you may either wait a short while for the new release to be packaged or else remove the obsolete package and perform a [manual installation](unix).

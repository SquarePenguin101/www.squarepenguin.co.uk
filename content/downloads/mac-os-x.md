# Mac OS X Quick Install Guide

## Option 1 - Get iPlayer Automator (Very easy)

There are a couple of options on Mac. The easiest of the two is to use Get iPlayer Automator, a free tool that greatly simplifies the process of downloading content from the BBC (and now ITV) and have it deposited straight into iTunes.

Most Mac users enjoy this 'just works' setup and are not interested in the details underlying the programme. If you fit this description you can [download Get iPlayer Automator](https://github.com/GetiPlayerAutomator/get-iplayer-automator/releases/) or find out more on the [Get iPlayer Automator site](https://github.com/GetiPlayerAutomator/get-iplayer-automator).

I have not used Get iPlayer Automator, so I can't help you with it, but you can visit the [Get iPlayer Automator issue tracker](https://github.com/GetiPlayerAutomator/get-iplayer-automator/issues) if you get stuck.

## Option 2 - Homebrew (easy)

Homebrew is a package management solution for Mac OS X. It's very easy to install, just go to the [Homebrew website](http://brew.sh/) and copy and paste the one line installation code into your terminal window. 

Once you've installed Homebrew, it's just a one more line to get get_iplayer installed:

    brew install dinkypumpkin/get_iplayer/get_iplayer

### Upgrade to future releases with:

    brew update
    brew upgrade get_iplayer
    
### Get started by reading the guides and release notes

There is loads of info in the [guides](/guides/) section to get you downloading programmes in a snap. Make sure you read the whole guide to understand what's happening and why you need to do things a certain way.

Find the [release notes](https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/wiki/releasenotes) in the wiki. Read at least the notes for the latest release. Things can change quite a lot between releases and you'll find explanations there as to why get_iplayer is working the way it is. 

## More info?

You can take a look at the [Mac OS X installation page](https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/wiki/osx/) in the wiki for a bit more info and for instructions on performing a manual installation.

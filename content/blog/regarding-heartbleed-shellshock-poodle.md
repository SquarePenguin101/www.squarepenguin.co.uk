It's been a busy time for System Administrators over the last few weeks and months. Several high profile and critical vulnerabilities were discovered in very commonly used software, software that is also used here on squarepenguin.co.uk.

It's common practice to be open about these types of issue, usually on a faster timescale than I am able to commit to right now! But to cut a long story short and without getting into the technicalities, all relevant measures were taken to immediately patch these vulnerabilities and due the the particular way this website is setup, at no point was it actually vulnerable to them in the first place.

To that end, I can confirm squarepenguin.co.uk is not and has not been vulnerable to Heartbleed, Shellshock or the most recently announced POODLE vulnerabilities.

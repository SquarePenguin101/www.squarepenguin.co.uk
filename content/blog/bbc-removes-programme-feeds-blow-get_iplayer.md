Sad news - the [BBC has today removed the feeds](http://iplayerhelp.external.bbc.co.uk/tv/feeds) used by get_iplayer to download shows using the [search or index number methods](/guides/tv-download-guide/#how-do-i-record-a-programme-with-get-iplayer),Â which means you can no longer download programmes using two of the must useful methods get_iplayer provides.

Further, due to the loss of these feeds get_iplayer can no longer schedule programmes for download - in short the PVR is now broken.

Thankfully you are still able to download programmes manually using the PID or URL methods. Take a look at the TV Download Guide for a [short guide on downloading using the PID method](/guides/tv-download-guide/#how-do-i-record-a-programme-with-get-iplayer) and dig into the documentation to see how to download using the URL method.

Other functionality such as the ability to specify output folders and other get_iplayer specific abilities are not affected as these are built into get_iplayer itself.

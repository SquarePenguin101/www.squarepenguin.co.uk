As the BBC marches ever onwards toward launching their new Nitro API they are slowly but surely shutting down the various feeds used by apps like get_iplayer to obtain relevant programme listings.

Today, the BBC has shut down the feeds currently being used by get_iplayer to obtain TV listings meaning users will now see multiple `WARNING: Failed to get programme index feed` warnings whilst attempting to update their TV Cache.

The good news is there is a [workaround for this issue that you can implement immediately](/forums/topic/the-bbc-has-blown-up-tv-listing-feeds-here-is-the-workaround/) (thanks to the hard work of get_iplayer maintainer dinkypumpkin).

A new version of get_iplayer is due to be released shortly that will enact this workaround more permanently - again thanks to the work of dinkypumpkin.

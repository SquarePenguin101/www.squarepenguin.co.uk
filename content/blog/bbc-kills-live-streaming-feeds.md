They're on a roll!

EDIT - [v2.93 returns live streaming functionality](/blog/get_iplayer-v2-93-released/)

Not content with just killing the ION feeds, the BBC has also removed the resources get_iplayer relies on to stream live TV.

get_iplayer maintainer dinkypumpkin states:
<blockquote>This problem is indicated by the following error messages:

ERROR: Failed to get version pid metadata from iplayer site
ERROR: Could not get version pid metadata

There is no workaround and no prognosis on when or if live TV streaming will be restored.</blockquote>
If you can't quite believe it, read the same thing again in a forum post <a href="/forums/topic/the-bbc-has-blown-up-live-tv-streaming-no-workaround/">here</a>.

So, for now, that's all folks!

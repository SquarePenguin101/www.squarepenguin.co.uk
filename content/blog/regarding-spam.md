Over the past few days some of you are being falsely rejected from this site by an over aggressive spam plugin. I apologise for the hassle and have identified the problem to be with Akismet integration with certain aspects of the site.

The various anti-spam methods in place here on the site have been reconfigured and all incorrect lockouts removed.

If you are still having trouble, you may get in touch through the <a href="/contact/">contact form</a> and I'll take a look at your individual case.

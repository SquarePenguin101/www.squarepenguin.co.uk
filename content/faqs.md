## Basic questions

### I'm not in the UK, can I use get_iplayer?

You need a UK IP address to use get_iplayer, just like you would if you used the BBC iPlayer service.

### Does get_iplayer circumvent DRM?

No. get_iplayer does not circumvent any digital rights management security (see the [BBC’s website](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6944830.stm) on how to do that with the Windows-only DRM content they provide).

get_iplayer does not circumvent any effective technological measures as the BBC does not implement any such measures.

The BBC uses RTMP, which is a streaming protocol now publicly published by Adobe. Sometimes they use RTMP ‘SWF verification’ which has proven to be ineffective in its current BBC implementation (flvstreamer cannot handle such verification requests so the stream is dropped and is then automatically resumed).

The WMA and RealAudio streams and likewise unprotected. The BBC may at some point choose to effectively protect their streams with DRM or some ‘effective technological measure’ in which case get_iplayer will no longer be a useful tool for those streams.

The BBC do implement DRM on their iPhone and Adobe Air downloadable files and therefore get_iplayer is not useful with those. The BBC iPlayer TV only works in the UK so that they can limit the reach of their output to UK TV Licence fee payers who fund iPlayer (although legally you do not require a licence to watch non-live iPlayer output).
